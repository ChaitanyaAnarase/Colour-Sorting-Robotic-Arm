# Colour-Sorting-Robotic-Arm
This project demonstrates the design and development of a Robotic Arm Pick and Place system with Colour Separation using an Arduino microcontroller. The system is designed to detect objects based on their colour, classify them, and place them in respective bins with minimal human intervention. 

# 🤖 Robotic Arm Pick and Place with Colour Separation  

This project demonstrates a **Robotic Arm** controlled by **Arduino UNO** to sort objects based on colour.  
The arm uses a **TCS3200 Colour Sensor** to detect RGB values, processes them in Arduino, and places the objects in correct bins using servo motors.

## ⚙️ Working
1. Object is placed in detection area.  
2. Colour sensor detects and sends RGB data to Arduino.  
3. Arduino processes and decides the target bin.  
4. Servo motors move the arm + gripper to place the object.  
5. LCD shows detected colour & action.
